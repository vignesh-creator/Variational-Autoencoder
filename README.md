# Variational-Autoencoder
This repository contains implementation of Variational Autoencoder 
and Conditional Variational Autoencoder...

The interesting thing about variational autoencoder which differs it from normal autoencoders is,A variational autoencoder (VAE) provides a probabilistic manner for describing an observation in latent space. 

Thus, rather than building an encoder which outputs a single value to describe each latent state attribute, we'll formulate our encoder to describe a probability distribution for each latent attribute.

The further explanation about VAE and CVAE is given in the respective project folders along with links of original paper
