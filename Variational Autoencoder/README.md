This folder contains implementation of Variational Autoencoder [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf)

This code also uses [Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) & inverse residual Networks to obtain good results. 

There are two .ipynb files, which can be used as an alternative if you have any problem in running .py files

After training:

Results

First row is original MNIST images
Second row is reconstructed image

Randomly generated image. The latent of the image is generated by taking mean of latent vectors of 10 images which belongs to class "5"
