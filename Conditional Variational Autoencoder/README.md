This folder contains implementation of [Conditional Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf(https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/file/8d55a249e6baa5c06772297520da2051-Paper.pdf))

This code also uses [Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) & inverse residual Networks to obtain good results. 

To train the Network,type the below command in your terminal or just run the Train file
```
python train.py
```

After training for 5 epochs:
